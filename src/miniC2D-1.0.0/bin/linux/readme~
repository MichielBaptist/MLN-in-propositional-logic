This readme contains detailed instructions on how to use MARG exact inference, MAP inference 
and parameter learning of Markov Logic Networks in propositional logic.

MARG, MAP use an mln file as input and weight learning produces one as output. The general
format of an mln file is the following:

	-------------------------------------------------
	|	<number of literals> <number of clauses>	|
	|	weight1 <literals> 0						|
	|	weight2 <literals> 0						|
	|	...											|
	-------------------------------------------------
	
	* The weight of the clauses may be any real number, and may be negative.

	* The list of literals (<literals>) is a disjuntion of the literals.
	  	-> e.g. a v b v c ...

	* A literal is assumed to be an integer between 1 and the number of literals. 
	  A literal may be negative.
	  
  	* A clause must always end in a 0.

examples of MLN's can be found in the mln_samples folder.

1) MARG exact inference.

MARG will calulate the probability of a literal of collection of literals, given a MLN file.
Marg can be calculated as follows:
	1) place an mln file in the bin/ folder. The mln file format is defined above and must be named "mln".
	2) place a query file in the bin/ folder. This file must be named "query_atoms".
		-> The query file format is as follows: <amount of query literals> <list of literals>
		   The list of query literals is a conjunction of these literals.
		   e.g. a ^ b ^ c ...
	3) optional: place an evidence file in the bin/ folder. This file must be named "evidence".
		-> The evidence file format is as follows: <amount of evidence literals> <list of literals>
		   The list of literals is a conjunction.
	4) run the solver by calling the "evidence_solver" or "no_evidence_solver".
